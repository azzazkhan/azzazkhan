# Full-stack web developer and designer

Hi I'm [Azzaz Khan](https://www.facebook.com/AKS2003/) and I love to develop front-end and backend web applications for medium and small scale projects.

I have interest in the following technologies.
### Web technologies
1. Static website development
2. Dynamic website development
3. Backend development (PHP & Node.js)
4. API development (Express.js)
5. MEVN Stack development (Vue.js)
6. Single Page Application development (Vue.js and partially React.js)
7. Website designing
8. Cloud Platforms (AWS and Google Cloud)

### Mobile development
1. Android development (Java and Kotlin)
2. Native app development (Flutter)

I've worked as a Freelancer and successfully delivered a couple of major projects on time and in budget and got a 4.6-star rating.

I am a **XII grade** student every day trying to learn something new and exciting.
